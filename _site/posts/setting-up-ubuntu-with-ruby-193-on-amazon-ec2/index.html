  <h1>Setting up Ubuntu with Ruby 1.9.3 on Amazon EC2</h1>
  <p class="meta"></p>

  <p>If you haven&#8217;t deployed a Ruby application on Amazon Web Services EC2 yet, you&#8217;re really missing out. It&#8217;s largely a simple and enjoyable process. I&#8217;m always impressed at how quickly servers can be provisioned on EC2. This is a guide on how I typically get a new project going on EC2.</p>

<h2 id='provisioning_the_server_on_ec2'>Provisioning the Server on EC2</h2>

<p>Head over to <a href='http://aws.amazon.com'>aws.amazon.com</a> to get started. Log-in then go to the <a href='https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/'>EC2 panel</a>, click Launch Instance. Choose the Classic Wizard, scroll and choose Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS (Note that it selects the 64 bit version by default, we&#8217;ll use that one). LTS (Long Term Support) releases are always the better choice because the&#8217;ll receive security and bug fixes for 5 years.</p>

<p>I typically choose to launch a Small Instance (m1.small) when I&#8217;m just getting a project started. A Small Instance will cost about $60/mo. Click continue, next you&#8217;ll be on the Storage Device Configuration, I typically leave the volume size at 8GiB. If my server is going to have some sort of persistent datastore, like MySQL or MongoDB, I&#8217;d probably bump the size of the volume up accordingly.</p>

<p>Click Continue again, leave a name for your instance, I&#8217;m naming mine blog, and continue to the next step. I usually create a new key pair for each server just to have tighter control of access. It really depends on how your manage access to your servers. In our case, we&#8217;ll name it blog, and download the key pair, don&#8217;t lose this file, it&#8217;ll probably be named blog.pem. Click continue.</p>

<p>Create a new Security Group. Let&#8217;s just name it the same as the instance, blog (you&#8217;re also required to leave a description).</p>

<p>Since we&#8217;ll be using a web server (HTTP), we&#8217;ll need port 80 open, as well as 22 so we can SSH to the server. Click continue again.</p>

<p>So this last step is just a summary of the instance, if everything looks good, launch it!</p>

<p>Before we get started let&#8217;s assign our server an Elastic IP address, click Elastic IPs in the left navigation menu. Allocate a new address then associate it with your EC2 Instance.</p>

<p>Next click Instances in the navigation menu, and take a look at your instance, it&#8217;s state should now say <strong>running</strong>.</p>

<h2 id='setting_up_the_server'>Setting up the Server</h2>

<p>Now fire up your terminal. Let&#8217;s first configure our SSH client so we don&#8217;t have to provide our credentials all the time. I usually keep all my key files in the same directory. So open up <code>~/.ssh/config</code>, mine looks like this for our blog project:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
Host 50.11.131.12
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile /Users/jpsilvashy/Projects/aws_keypairs/blog.pem
</pre>
<p>Lastly before you can SSH to your new server change the permissions of the key pair file to 600.</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
chmod 600 /Users/jpsilvashy/Projects/aws_keypairs/blog.pem
</pre>
<p>Next, SSH to the server as the &#8220;ubuntu&#8221; user.</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
ssh ubuntu@50.11.131.12
</pre>
<p>Okay, you should be logged into the server now! Good job! Now it&#8217;s time to get our hands dirty. We&#8217;ll be using <code>apt-get</code>, to setup most of the packages we&#8217;ll need. Let&#8217;s first make sure we have all the latest updates for Ubuntu.</p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></p>

<p>Next, let&#8217;s get some of the basic packages that we&#8217;ll need installed, this will help with the remainder of the setup.</p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get install git build essentials
</code></p>

<p>So to clear things up, that&#8217;ll install Git, and the complication tools you&#8217;ll need to build the other packages, like GCC.</p>
