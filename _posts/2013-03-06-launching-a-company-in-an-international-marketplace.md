Just hours ago LAUNCH Conference 2013 ended. First things first, LAUNCH was the coolest tech conference I've ever been to by a landslide. Issac and I launched our business Flyer.

## Watch our pitch below

## Judges feedback

Addressing one of our Judges, Brendon Kim's (from Samsung Venture Capital & Private Equity) questions "am I generating a paper flyer or an online flyer?" We use the phrase "Flyer" not only in the literal sense of the standard paper marketing flyer. Our end users get to create, design, update and share their own personal website for each of their real estate listings.

Along with the conference accredited investors we're able to commit investments to the businesses they wanted to invest in. A sort of real-time crowd funding meets Angellist as an iOS app type of thingâ€¦ Yah I know, I didn't get it at first either, then it all came together when you started seeing the investments being made on some of the other companies while they were still on stage. One example of this was AdStage, they have an amazing product.

My business Flyer.io ended in 5th place with about $800k in real-life committed funding from actual investors. We are amped. Flyer began a bit more humbly as an attempt to bring new tools and a marketing platform to a market with antiquated solutions.

We feel that the product is awesome. I'm really thankful to all our beta users who have been giving us great feedback. The product is a reflection of our users feedback and our dedication to creating a great technology platform for our clients to place their trust.

Anyhow, Jason Calacanis, his team, especially Tyler Crowley, those dudes know how to make an awesome conference happen.
